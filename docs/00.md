herding cats
============

This is a log of me going through Cats, a functional programming library for Scala
that is currently *experimental* and under active development.
I'll try to follow the structure of [learning Scalaz][lsz] that I wrote in 2012 (!).

Cats' [website][cats] says the name is a playful shortening of the word category.
It says coordinating programmers is like herding cats
(as in attempting to move dozens of them in a direction like cattle, while cats have their own ideas),
and it seems to be true at least for those of us using Scala. Keenly aware of this situation, Cats' site lists
approachability as the first motivation.

Cats also looks interesting from the technical perspective.
With its approachability and Erik Asheim ([@d6][@d6]/[@non][@non])'s awesomeness,
[people][contributors] are gathering around them with new ideas such as
Michael Pilquist ([@mpilquist][@mpilquist])'s [simulacrum][simulacrum] and
Miles Sabin ([@milessabin][@milessabin])'s deriving typeclasses.
Hopefully I'll learn more in the coming days.
