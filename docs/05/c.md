### List monad

LYAHFGG:

> On the other hand, a value like `[3,8,9]` contains several results, so we can view it as one value that is actually many values at the same time. Using lists as applicative functors showcases this non-determinism nicely.

Let's look at using `List` as Applicatives again:

```console:new
scala> import cats._, cats.std.all._, cats.syntax.apply._
scala> (List(1, 2, 3) |@| List(10, 100, 100)) { _ * _ }
```

> let's try feeding a non-deterministic value to a function:

```console
scala> import cats.syntax.flatMap._
scala> List(3, 4, 5) >>= { x => List(x, -x) }
```

So in this monadic view, `List` context represent mathematical value that could have multiple solutions. Other than that manipulating `List`s using `for` notation is just like plain Scala:

```console
scala> for {
         n <- List(1, 2)
         ch <- List('a', 'b')
       } yield (n, ch)
```
