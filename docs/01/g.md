### `Enum`

LYAHFGG:

> `Enum` members are sequentially ordered types â€” they can be enumerated. The main advantage of the `Enum` typeclass is that we can use its types in list ranges. They also have defined successors and predecessors, which you can get with the `succ` and `pred` functions.

I could not find Cats' equivalent for this typeclass.

It's not an `Enum` or range, but [non/spire][spire] has an interesting data structure called `Interval`.
