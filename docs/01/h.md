### `Numeric`

LYAHFGG:

I could not find Cats' equivalent for this typeclass,
but [spire][spire] defines `Numeric`. Cats doesn't define `Bounds` either.

So far we've seen some of typeclasses that are *not* defined in Cats.
This is not necessarily a bad thing because having a tight core is part of the design goal of Cats.
